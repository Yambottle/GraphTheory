1. Use loop to show when a graph contains Eulerian Trail only
2. If each vertex has even degree, Eulerian Trail can be any path, and it was highlighted by all red vertices and edges
3. If it contains two odd-degree vertices, find the largest odd degree as start(shown by blue), and create a temp value ‘next’, then for each iteration, ‘next’ points to the largest degree it can reach. Finally, end vertex is shown by green color.
